## Your Tasks

You are required to write code for the following topics:

- Basic functions
- Sum functions
- For loops
- List manipulations
- A combination of the above

Each topic has its own test file in the `testfiles/` directory. Make sure to write your code in a file named `student_code.py` at the root level of this repository.

## How to Test Your Code

Navigate to the root directory of this repository and run the test scripts one by one like so:

\\\bash
python testfiles/test_hello_function.py
python testfiles/test_sum_function.py
python testfiles/test_for_loop.py
python testfiles/test_list_function.py
python testfiles/test_combined.py
\\\

Each test will output your score for that specific task. Aim for a perfect score!

## Autograding

When you push your code to this repository, GitHub Classroom will automatically grade your submission based on the test files. Check your grade once the tests are done running.
